# HistoricalStockAnalysis

Primary code is in 'historicalstockanalysis.py', written in Python as the extension implies

Stock data pulled from Alpha Vantage in November 2017

To run the script:
Download 'historicalstockanalysis.py', 'NASDAQ.txt', and 'formattedNASDAQ.zip'. 
Make sure all in the same directory. 
Unzip formattedNASDAQ.zip. This creates a folder in the directory with all of the stock data. This is functionally my database.
From terminal, navigate to the directory using the 'cd' command, then enter (without the "") "python ./historicalstockanalysis.py"
